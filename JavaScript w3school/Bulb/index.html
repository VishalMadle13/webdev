                History of the lotus flower
                Back in Egyptians times, the lotus flower was very important in their religion.
                Meaning creation and rebirth, it was a symbol of the sun, because at nightfall it 
                closes and goes beneath the water and at dawn it climbs up above the water and reopens. 
                It was the only plant to flower and fruit at the same time, as it would emerge as pure 
                white from the depths of the muddy swamp and grow above the water. One myth that 
                revolves around the lotus is during creation time a giant lotus flower grew out of a 
                pond and from it the sun rose. Also, throughout ancient Egypt the lotus has been 
                pictured in various works of art.  It would act as a border to outline a section of 
                artwork, or held in the hands of a god or human. The lotus was also used in their math, 
                helping to count to high decrees. One lotus would act as 1,000 and two lotus
